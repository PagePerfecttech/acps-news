# Security Fixes for FlipNEWS

This document outlines the security fixes that have been applied to the FlipNEWS application.

## 1. Removed Hardcoded API Keys

Hardcoded API keys have been removed from the following files:

- `app\lib\supabase.ts`
- `scripts\check-storage.js`
- `scripts\init-storage.js`
- `scripts\init-categories.js`
- `scripts\fix-database.js`
- `vercel.json`

All scripts now use environment variables instead of hardcoded values.

## 2. Fixed Memory Leaks

Memory leaks have been fixed in the following components:

- `app\hooks\useRealtimeSubscription.ts`: Added proper cleanup for interval timers and added isMounted flag to prevent state updates after component unmount.

## 3. Fixed Missing Dependencies in useEffect Hooks

- `app\hooks\useEnvironment.ts`: Added comment explaining why the empty dependency array is appropriate.
- `app\components\NewsCard.tsx`: Added comment explaining why recordView doesn't need to be in the dependency array.

## 4. Fixed Async Function Handling

- `app\admin\news\add\page.tsx`: Fixed async function handling by properly awaiting the getCategories() function.
- `app\admin\news\edit\[id]\page.tsx`: Fixed async function handling by properly awaiting the getCategories() function.

## How to Set Up Environment Variables

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Fill in your actual values in the `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ...
   ```

3. For Vercel deployment, update the environment variables in `vercel.json` or set them in the Vercel dashboard.

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Enable ESLint and TypeScript Error Checking**: Update your Next.js configuration to enable ESLint and TypeScript error checking during builds.

2. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to your API routes to prevent abuse.

3. **Add Content Security Policy**: Implement a Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks.

4. **Regular Security Audits**: Regularly audit your codebase for security vulnerabilities.

5. **Use Environment Variables for All Sensitive Information**: Never hardcode sensitive information in your codebase.
